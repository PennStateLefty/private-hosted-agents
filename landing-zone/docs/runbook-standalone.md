# Runbook — Standalone deployment

This runbook covers the simplest deployment scenario: a single Azure subscription, no external hub, all networking and platform resources owned by the AI Landing Zone itself.

This is the default `deploymentMode=standalone` setting and is what `azd init -t azure/bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone` produces out of the box.

> If you're building an AI workload that integrates with an existing Application Landing Zone, use the [Hub-and-Spoke runbook](./runbook-hub-spoke.md) instead.

## 1. What you'll end up with

```
+--------------------------------------------------+
|  Single VNet (192.168.0.0/22)                    |
|  rg-ailz-MMDDYYHHMM                              |
|                                                  |
|    AI Foundry account + project                  |
|    Container Apps Environment (internal)         |
|    AI Search, Cosmos DB, Key Vault, ACR, Storage |
|    App Configuration                             |
|    Application Insights + Log Analytics WS       |
|    Azure Firewall (egress control)               |
|    Azure Bastion (jumpbox access)                |
|    Jumpbox VM (private IP only)                  |
|    NAT Gateway                                   |
|    Private Endpoints + Private DNS zones         |
+--------------------------------------------------+
```

All in a single resource group, no peering, no external dependencies.

## 2. Prerequisites

| What | Why |
| --- | --- |
| Azure subscription with **Contributor** + **User Access Administrator** | Resources + RBAC |
| `az` ≥ 2.60, `azd` ≥ 1.25, PowerShell 7 | Tooling |
| ≥ 10 vCPU quota for `standardDSv2Family` (jumpbox + ACA env) | Default sizing |
| ≥ 5 vCPU quota for `standardDdsv5Family` in your target region | AI Foundry compute |

```pwsh
az login
azd auth login
az account set --subscription '<your-subscription-id>'
```

---

## 3. Initialize the project

You can either work from a fresh `azd init` (consumer pattern) or directly from the repo.

### 3.1. Consumer / `azd init` pattern (recommended for production use)

```pwsh
azd init -t azure/bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone
cd <project-folder>
```

This downloads the template into a new folder. You'll customize `main.parameters.json` here without touching the source repo.

### 3.2. Local repo pattern (recommended for landing-zone development)

```pwsh
git clone https://github.com/Azure/bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone.git
cd bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone
```

---

## 4. Configure the deployment

Choose between **basic** (public, no isolation) for demos and **Zero Trust** (production) below.

### 4.1. Basic (demo) deployment

```pwsh
azd env new ailz-demo
```

That's it — defaults are fine. PaaS planes are public, no PEs, no firewall. Skip ahead to [§5 Provision](#5-provision).

### 4.2. Zero Trust (production) deployment

```pwsh
$stamp = Get-Date -Format 'MMddyyHHmm'
azd env new "ailz-$stamp"

azd env set NETWORK_ISOLATION true
azd env set DEPLOYMENT_MODE standalone        # default; included for clarity
azd env set DEPLOY_JUMPBOX true
azd env set DEPLOY_BASTION true
azd env set DEPLOY_NAT_GATEWAY true
azd env set DEPLOY_AZURE_FIREWALL true
```

The five `DEPLOY_*` flags above match what v1.x used to gate behind the single `DEPLOY_VM` flag. They're listed individually here so you can turn any single one off — for instance, `DEPLOY_AZURE_FIREWALL false` if your egress is managed by a central policy at the management-group level, or `DEPLOY_BASTION false` if you have a workstation reaching the spoke via a corporate VPN.

#### Optional: allow specific developer IPs through PaaS planes

```pwsh
azd env set ALLOWED_IP_RANGES '["203.0.113.10/32","198.51.100.0/24"]'
```

These CIDRs become the only public IPs allowed to hit the data planes of Storage, Key Vault, App Configuration, ACR, Cosmos DB, AI Search, and the AI Foundry storage account. Useful for letting a development laptop talk to Cosmos directly without RDP'ing into the jumpbox. Combine with `NETWORK_ISOLATION=true` for defense in depth — workloads talk through PEs, named developers also have an exception.

#### Optional: Foundry inference-only

```pwsh
azd env set DEPLOY_AAF_AGENT_SVC false
```

This keeps the AI Foundry account, project, and model deployments, but skips the Agent Service Standard Setup and its associated AI Search, Storage, Cosmos DB, and Key Vault resources. `DEPLOY_SEARCH_SERVICE` remains independent and controls only the workload/RAG Search service.

#### Optional: GPT-RAG Foundry IQ Pattern B

Use this only for a GPT-RAG environment that has been validated for Foundry IQ.
Pattern B registers the existing GPT-RAG Azure AI Search index as a Foundry IQ
`searchIndex` knowledge source.

```pwsh
azd env set RETRIEVAL_BACKEND foundry_iq
azd env set FOUNDRY_IQ_PATTERN searchIndex
azd env set FOUNDRY_IQ_API_VERSION 2026-05-01-preview
azd env set FOUNDRY_IQ_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_BILLING_PLAN free
azd env set FOUNDRY_IQ_FILTER_ADD_ON_ENABLED true
```

After `azd provision`, run `scripts/Configure-FoundryIQKnowledgeBase.ps1` to
create or update the Search data-plane knowledge source and knowledge base. The
caller needs **Search Service Contributor** on the Search service. Set
`FOUNDRY_IQ_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_BILLING_PLAN=standard` only after billing
approval.

#### Optional: jumpbox post-config bootstrap

`main.bicep` ships an `install.ps1` Custom Script Extension that installs az/azd/git/PowerShell modules and clones the repos listed in `manifest.json` into `C:\github\`. To run it during provisioning:

```pwsh
azd env set DEPLOY_SOFTWARE true
```

You can leave it off (`false`) and run the bootstrap manually after RDP'ing into the jumpbox via Bastion.

---

## 5. Provision

```pwsh
azd provision
```

> A **pre-flight script** (`scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.ps1`) runs automatically as an `azd preprovision` hook before the deployment touches Azure. It validates the parameter set and fails fast on deterministic mistakes (CIDR overlap, missing BYO resources, conflicting flags, and insufficient AI Foundry OpenAI model quota). Bypass with `$env:PREFLIGHT_SKIP = 'true'` if needed. See [docs/v2-migration.md §6](./v2-migration.md#6-pre-flight-validation-script).

**Expected duration**:

| Topology | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Basic (no isolation) | ~10–15 min |
| Zero Trust without firewall | ~20–25 min |
| Zero Trust full (firewall + jumpbox + bootstrap) | ~30–40 min |

If `azd` reports "Login expired" mid-deploy, run `azd auth login` and re-run `azd provision`. The in-flight ARM deployment continues server-side; `azd` just lost its progress stream.

---

## 6. Verify

```pwsh
$rg = azd env get-value AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP

az resource list -g $rg --query "length(@)" -o tsv
az containerapp list -g $rg --query "[].{name:name,fqdn:properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn}" -o table
az vm get-instance-view -g $rg -n (az vm list -g $rg --query "[0].name" -o tsv) `
    --query "instanceView.statuses[?starts_with(code,'PowerState')].displayStatus" -o tsv
```

Expected: ~60 resources for basic, ~80 for Zero Trust full. Container App FQDN is the public DNS for the ACA env (which under `networkIsolation=true` is internal-only and only resolves to a private IP from inside the VNet).

---

## 7. Test the hello-world app

### 7.1. Basic (public) deployment

```pwsh
$fqdn = az containerapp show -g $rg -n (az containerapp list -g $rg --query "[0].name" -o tsv) --query "properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn" -o tsv
curl http://$fqdn
```

You should see the ASP.NET hello-world HTML.

### 7.2. Zero Trust deployment — via the jumpbox

Under `networkIsolation=true` the Container App is **not** reachable from your workstation. Test from the jumpbox:

```pwsh
$vmName = az vm list -g $rg --query "[0].name" -o tsv
$fqdn   = az containerapp show -g $rg -n (az containerapp list -g $rg --query "[0].name" -o tsv) --query "properties.configuration.ingress.fqdn" -o tsv

# Non-interactive equivalent of "RDP in and run curl":
$script = @"
try {
    `$r = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://$fqdn' -UseBasicParsing -TimeoutSec 30
    Write-Host ('Status=' + `$r.StatusCode + ' Len=' + `$r.Content.Length)
} catch { Write-Host ('ERROR: ' + `$_.Exception.Message) }
"@

az vm run-command invoke -g $rg -n $vmName --command-id RunPowerShellScript --scripts $script --query "value[0].message" -o tsv
```

Expected: `Status=200 Len=3753`.

### 7.3. Interactive RDP via Bastion

Reset the jumpbox password first (Azure portal → VM → **Support + troubleshooting → Reset password**, username `testvmuser`), then:

```pwsh
$bastionName = az network bastion list -g $rg --query "[0].name" -o tsv
$vmId        = az vm show -g $rg -n $vmName --query id -o tsv

az network bastion rdp --name $bastionName --resource-group $rg --target-resource-id $vmId
```

Once logged in, open the browser and navigate to `http://<container-app-fqdn>`.

---

## 8. Tear down

```pwsh
azd down --force --purge
```

`--purge` immediately purges soft-deleted Key Vault / App Configuration / Cognitive Services accounts so the names are available for the next deployment.

---

## 9. Common knobs

These are the parameters most operators tweak after the first deploy. Set them via `azd env set` (and re-`azd provision`) or in `main.parameters.json`.

| Env var | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NETWORK_ISOLATION` | `false` | Zero Trust mode: PEs + Private DNS + public access disabled on PaaS |
| `ALLOWED_IP_RANGES` | `[]` | Public IP CIDRs allowed through PaaS data planes (independent of `NETWORK_ISOLATION`) |
| `DEPLOY_AZURE_FIREWALL` | `true` (Zero Trust only) | Set `false` if your egress is managed centrally |
| `DEPLOY_JUMPBOX` | inherits `DEPLOY_VM` | Jumpbox VM for in-VNet operations |
| `DEPLOY_BASTION` | inherits `DEPLOY_VM` | Azure Bastion to reach the jumpbox |
| `DEPLOY_NAT_GATEWAY` | inherits `DEPLOY_VM` | NAT Gateway for jumpbox outbound traffic |
| `DEPLOY_SEARCH_SERVICE` | `true` | Set `false` to skip AI Search (saves ~$75/mo and 7 minutes of provision time) |
| `DEPLOY_POSTGRES` | `false` | Set `true` to add Postgres Flexible Server |
| `AZURE_SEARCH_LOCATION` | same as `AZURE_LOCATION` | Cross-region Search (PE still in spoke region) — workaround for regional SKU capacity |
| `BASTION_SKU_NAME` | `Standard` | `Basic`, `Standard`, or `Premium` |
| `BASTION_ENABLE_TUNNELING` | `false` | Set `true` for native-client tunneling (RDP/SSH via `az network bastion rdp/ssh`) |
| `DEPLOY_SOFTWARE` | `true` when `DEPLOY_VM=true` | Run jumpbox post-config Custom Script Extension during provision |
| `EXTEND_FIREWALL_FOR_JUMPBOX_BOOTSTRAP` | `true` when `DEPLOY_VM=true` | Add jumpbox-scoped FQDN rules to the firewall |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS` | `{ enabled: false }` | Set to `{ enabled: true, ... }` to add an Application Gateway WAF v2 in front of the internal ACA env |

For the full list, see `main.bicep` parameters and `main.parameters.json`.

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| `InsufficientResourcesAvailable` on AI Search | `azd env set AZURE_SEARCH_LOCATION eastus` (or another sibling region) and re-`azd provision` |
| `NameUnavailable: appcs-... is already in use` | Previous Key Vault / App Config in soft-delete state; `az appconfig purge --name <name> --yes` then `az keyvault purge --name <name> --location <loc>` |
| `Login expired` mid-deploy | `azd auth login` and re-`azd provision`; in-flight deployment continues server-side |
| Container App returns 502 | Image pull failure: `az containerapp logs show -g <rg> -n <ca>`; if it's an MCR pull, check the firewall `AllowMicrosoftContainerRegistry` rule (it's on by default) |
| Jumpbox post-config script (CSE) failed | Open the VM in the portal → **Settings → Extensions → AzureCustomScriptExtension** to see the error. Common cause: firewall blocking an FQDN the bootstrap needs — see the firewall egress allow-list table in the [main README](../README.md#firewall-egress-allow-list-network-isolation) |
| Provision succeeded but DNS doesn't resolve PaaS FQDNs from the jumpbox | The Private DNS zone is not linked to the spoke VNet, or you set a BYO override (`EXISTING_PRIVATE_DNS_ZONE_*_RESOURCE_ID`) pointing at a zone in a different VNet without manually creating the link |
