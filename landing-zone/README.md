# Azure AI Landing Zone

## Overview

The Azure AI Landing Zone is an enterprise-scale, production-ready reference architecture designed to deploy secure and resilient AI applications and agents on Azure. This repository contains the Bicep implementation, the Terraform implementations are available in separate repositories.

## What's new in v2

The v2 line adds two things that matter most for everyday use:

1. **A topology switch** — set `deploymentMode` to one of:
    - **`standalone`** — the AI Landing Zone provisions everything it needs (VNet, private endpoints, Bastion, jumpbox, NAT Gateway, observability). Best for sandboxes, evaluations, and teams without a corporate hub.
    - **`ailz-integrated`** — the AI Landing Zone deploys only the **spoke** (VNet + private endpoints + AI services) and peers into a hub VNet you already operate, **reusing** the hub's Firewall, Bastion, Private DNS zones, and Log Analytics workspace. Best for production inside an existing Azure Landing Zone.
2. **Granular reuse of existing resources** — every platform service can be brought from the outside via an `existing*ResourceId` parameter (cross-subscription IDs are accepted): Log Analytics, Application Insights, Private DNS zones (per zone, 15 available), hub VNet, jumpbox, Bastion, NAT Gateway, route table.

A handful of other quality-of-life additions:

- **`allowedIpRanges`** — let named CIDRs reach the data plane of Storage, Key Vault, Cosmos DB, AI Search, ACR, AI Foundry, and App Configuration without disabling private endpoints. Use this when developers need to query the workload from their laptops without routing through Bastion.
- **Decoupled hub components** — `deployJumpbox`, `deployBastion`, and `deployNatGateway` are now independent flags. No more all-or-nothing `deployVM`.
- **Hub integration helpers** — `hubIntegration.hubVnetResourceId` creates the spoke→hub peering for you; `hubIntegration.egressNextHopIp` routes spoke egress through your hub firewall / NVA.
- **Pre-flight validation** — `scripts/Invoke-PreflightChecks.ps1` runs automatically as an `azd preprovision` hook and catches the usual mistakes (CIDR overlap, undersized subnets, missing BYO resource IDs, conflicting flags, and insufficient AI Foundry OpenAI model quota) before they reach ARM. Bypass with `PREFLIGHT_SKIP=true`.
- **AI Foundry project naming** — `aiFoundryProjectName`, `aiFoundryProjectDisplayName`, and `aiFoundryProjectDescription` let consumers customize the deployed AI Foundry project instead of using a hardcoded default.
- **Foundry IQ groundwork for GPT-RAG:** set `RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=foundry_iq` to stamp the orchestrator settings for a Foundry IQ knowledge base. See [Foundry IQ for GPT-RAG](#foundry-iq-for-gpt-rag) for parameters, security expectations, billing, and the post-provision script.

**Pick a runbook to deploy:**

- **[Standalone deployment](docs/runbook-standalone.md)** — single subscription, AI LZ owns all networking and platform resources.
- **[Hub-and-spoke deployment](docs/runbook-hub-spoke.md)** — spoke inside an existing Landing Zone, hub provides the platform.

If you're upgrading from v1.x, see the **[migration guide](docs/v2-migration.md)** — it shows what changed in v2 and the parameters you may need to update.

## How to Deploy

Choose your preferred deployment method based on project requirements and environment constraints.

### Prerequisites

**Required Permissions:**

- Azure subscription with **Contributor** and **User Access Admin** roles
- Agreement to Responsible AI terms for Azure AI Services

**Required Tools:**

- [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli)
- [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/install-azd)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> Azure CLI is included as a prerequisite for future pre/post provisioning hooks that may depend on it.

### Basic Deployment

Quick setup for demos without network isolation.

**Initialize the project**

```
azd init -t azure/bicep-ptn-aiml-landing-zone
```

**Sign in to Azure**

```
az login
azd auth login
```

> Add `--tenant` for `az` or `--tenant-id` for `azd` if you want a specific tenant.

**Provision Infrastructure**

```
azd provision
```
> **Optional:** You can change parameter values in `main.parameters.json` or set them using `azd env set` before running `azd provision`. The latter applies only to parameters that support environment variable substitution.

### Resource naming

By default, generated resource names follow the Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF)
pattern `type-workload-environment-region-instance`, for example
`kv-a1b2c3-dev-eus2-001`. You do not have to set anything: every CAF token has a
safe default, so a plain `azd provision` produces valid, readable names.

The CAF tokens and their defaults:

- `CAF_WORKLOAD_NAME`: short deterministic hash derived from subscription,
  environment, and location. Override with a meaningful name such as `contosoai`.
- `CAF_ENVIRONMENT_NAME`: the azd environment name.
- `CAF_REGION_NAME`: the deployment location from azd (`AZURE_LOCATION`), mapped
  to a short region code (`eastus2` becomes `eus2`).
- `CAF_INSTANCE`: `001`. Increment only for a second parallel copy of the same
  workload in the same environment and region.

To override a token:

```
azd env set CAF_WORKLOAD_NAME contosoai
```

Names are length-bounded automatically so they stay within Azure limits
(storage 24, Key Vault 24, Container Apps environment 32, and so on). Because the
tokens are deterministic, redeploying the same environment produces the same
names (idempotent).

Explicit resource-name parameters such as `aiFoundryAccountName`,
`containerRegistryName`, `keyVaultName`, `storageAccountName`, and `vnetName`
continue to override generated names in either naming mode.

**Upgrading an existing deployment:** CAF is now the default. To keep the older
`resourceToken`-based names and avoid renaming existing resources, pin the legacy
mode before provisioning:

```
azd env set RESOURCE_NAMING_MODE legacy
```

### Zero Trust Deployment

For deployments that **require network isolation**.

**Before Provisioning**

Enable network isolation in your environment:

```
azd env set NETWORK_ISOLATION true
```

> **Optional:** Update other parameters in `main.parameters.json` or via `azd env set` before provisioning.

Make sure you're signed in with your Azure user account:

```
az login
azd auth login
```

> Add `--tenant` for `az` or `--tenant-id` for `azd` if you want a specific tenant.

**Provision Infrastructure**

```
azd provision
```

**Using the Jumpbox VM**

1. **Reset the VM password** in the Azure Portal (required on first access if not set in deployment parameters):

   - Go to your VM resource → **Support + troubleshooting** → **Reset password** → Set new credentials
   - Default username is `testvmuser`

2. **Connect via Azure Bastion**

#### Cloning extra repositories onto the jumpbox

The default `install.ps1` bootstrap clones this repository to `C:\github\ai-lz` and walks `manifest.json#components` for additional repos. Downstream solution accelerators that consume this landing zone as a Bicep module / git submodule and need their own application repository present on the jumpbox (for private-network data-plane post-provisioning — Cosmos seeding, AI Search index creation, sample data loading, etc.) declare those repos in their **overlay** `manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "tag": "v1.0.0",
  "ailz_tag": "v1.1.1",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "voice-app",
      "repo": "https://github.com/Contoso/voice-app.git",
      "tag": "v0.3.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

`main.bicep` derives the URLs/tags/names from `_manifest.components` at compile time and forwards them to `install.ps1` over the CSE `commandToExecute`. Each entry is cloned into `C:\github\<name>` on the jumpbox. `tag` defaults to `main`; `name` defaults to the repo URL basename without `.git`. There are no per-deployment Bicep parameters to wire — `manifest.json` is the single source of truth, the same one consumers already use to pin their `ailz_tag` release.

#### Building and pushing images with network isolation

When `networkIsolation=true`, the Container Registry is deployed as **Premium** with `publicNetworkAccess=Disabled` and is only reachable via its private endpoint. `az acr build` against the shared Microsoft-managed builder will fail. This landing zone therefore provisions an **ACR Tasks agent pool** attached to the `devops-build-agents-subnet` so image builds run inside the VNet and push to the registry over its private endpoint. No Docker client is required (and the jumpbox has no Docker installed by design — see issue #14).

Build and push from the jumpbox (or any client that can reach ARM):

```powershell
$acr  = (azd env get-values | Select-String '^AZURE_CONTAINER_REGISTRY_ENDPOINT').Line.Split('=')[1].Trim('"').Split('.')[0]
$pool = (azd env get-values | Select-String '^ACR_TASK_AGENT_POOL').Line.Split('=')[1].Trim('"')

az acr build `
  -r $acr `
  --agent-pool $pool `
  -t myapp:latest `
  -f Dockerfile `
  .
```

Pause billing between builds (default tier `S1` is billed per hour whether idle or not):

```powershell
az acr agentpool update -r <acr> -n <pool> --count 0
```

Resume before the next build:

```powershell
az acr agentpool update -r <acr> -n <pool> --count 1
```

The agent pool can be disabled entirely with `deployAcrTaskAgentPool=false` if builds are handled by a central CI/CD runner that already reaches the registry's private endpoint.

#### Firewall egress allow-list (network isolation)

When `networkIsolation=true`, egress from the jumpbox and workload subnets is forced through the default Azure Firewall. The landing zone codifies the FQDNs required by the default `install.ps1` bootstrap and by the ACR Tasks agent pool. The set is split by purpose so you can audit or trim it:

- ACR Tasks control plane and registry: `*.azurecr.io`, `*.data.azurecr.io`, and Azure Storage queue/blob/table FQDNs.
- Language/runtime feeds: Python.org, PyPI, npm.
- OS package feeds: Debian, Ubuntu, Yarn, and `packages.microsoft.com` for Microsoft-supported Linux packages such as `msodbcsql18`.

If your application build needs additional HTTPS endpoints, add them to the `additionalAcrTaskBuildFqdns` array parameter. The values are appended to the ACR Tasks HTTPS runtime rule only when `networkIsolation`, `deployAzureFirewall`, `deployAcrTaskAgentPool`, and `extendFirewallForAcrTaskBuilds` are all enabled, and are scoped to the `devops-build-agents-subnet`.

| Rule | Source subnet | FQDN group | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `AllowMicrosoftContainerRegistry` | `*` | `mcr.microsoft.com`, `*.data.mcr.microsoft.com` | ACA/agents/ACR Tasks pulling Microsoft base images |
| `AllowEntraIdAuth` | `*` | `login.microsoftonline.com`, `login.windows.net`, `management.azure.com`, `graph.microsoft.com`, `*.applicationinsights.azure.com` | Entra ID auth, ARM control plane, App Insights telemetry |
| `AllowGitHub` | `*` | `github.com`, `*.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `*.githubusercontent.com` | Repo clones, release downloads |
| `AllowJumpboxBootstrap` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | Chocolatey, NuGet, VS Installer, `download.microsoft.com`, `aka.ms`, `go.microsoft.com`, `*.core.windows.net`, `*.azureedge.net` | `choco install`, VS Code/PowerShell Core/Azure CLI/AZD MSIs (Python is installed from python.org embeddable zip — see `AllowJumpboxDevRuntimes`) |
| `AllowJumpboxDevRuntimes` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `*.python.org`, `*.pypi.org`, `*.pythonhosted.org`, `*.pypa.io`, `*.npmjs.org` | `pip install`, `npm install`, jumpbox Python embeddable-zip install + `get-pip.py` bootstrap |
| `AllowJumpboxEditors` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `update.code.visualstudio.com`, `*.vo.msecnd.net`, `*.vscode-cdn.net` | VS Code updates |
| `AllowJumpboxAcme` | `jumpboxSubnetPrefix` | `api.github.com`, `acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org` | win-acme release discovery + ACME v2 issuance/renewal from jumpbox |
| `AllowAcrTasks` | `devopsBuildAgentsSubnetPrefix` | `*.azurecr.io`, `*.data.azurecr.io` | ACR Tasks agent pool talking to its registry |

Set `extendFirewallForJumpboxBootstrap=false` to skip the jumpbox-scoped rules when egress is managed centrally by another policy.

### AI Foundry deployment modes

`deployAiFoundry` controls the base AI Foundry account, project, and model deployments. `deployAAfAgentSvc` controls the Agent Service Standard Setup and its associated AI Search, Storage, Cosmos DB, and Key Vault resources. `deploySearchService` controls only the workload/RAG Azure AI Search service used by applications.

| Scenario | Parameters |
| --- | --- |
| Full Foundry Agent Service setup | `deployAiFoundry=true`, `deployAAfAgentSvc=true` |
| Foundry inference-only | `deployAiFoundry=true`, `deployAAfAgentSvc=false` |
| Workload Search only | `deploySearchService=true`, independent of `deployAAfAgentSvc` |
| No Foundry resources | `deployAiFoundry=false` |

Use `DEPLOY_AAF_AGENT_SVC=false` when an external app only needs hosted model inference from Foundry and does not need Agent Service capability hosts or their associated state resources.

### Foundry IQ for GPT-RAG

The landing zone stamps GPT-RAG runtime settings for a Foundry IQ knowledge
base. New deployments default to Foundry IQ. Existing GPT-RAG deployments can
stay on `RETRIEVAL_BACKEND=ai_search` until the operator intentionally migrates.

| Parameter / env var | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `retrievalBackend` / `RETRIEVAL_BACKEND` | `foundry_iq` | Selects direct Azure AI Search or Foundry IQ. Existing deployments can keep `ai_search` until they migrate. |
| `foundryIqPattern` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_PATTERN` | `azureBlob` | `azureBlob` uses native Foundry IQ Blob or ADLS Gen2 ingestion. `managed` is accepted as a compatibility alias for `azureBlob`. `searchIndex` remains an explicit Pattern B opt-in for existing GPT-RAG Azure AI Search indexes. |
| `knowledgeBaseName` / `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME` | `knowledge-base` | Name stamped into `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME`. |
| `knowledgeBaseConnectionName` / `KNOWLEDGE_BASE_CONNECTION_NAME` | `knowledge-base-connection` | Dedicated AI Foundry Search connection for knowledge-base use. |
| `foundryIqApiVersion` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_API_VERSION` | `2026-05-01-preview` | Required for per-user permissions and Pattern B `filterAddOn`. |
| `foundryIqKnowledgeRetrievalBillingPlan` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_KNOWLEDGE_RETRIEVAL_BILLING_PLAN` | `free` | Azure AI Search `knowledgeRetrieval` billing plan. Set `standard` only after billing approval. |
| `foundryIqKnowledgeSourceName` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_KNOWLEDGE_SOURCE_NAME` | `knowledge-base-blob-ks` | Native Blob Knowledge Source name by default; also used as the Pattern B source name when `searchIndex` is selected. |
| `foundryIqKnowledgeSourceKind` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_KNOWLEDGE_SOURCE_KIND` | `azureBlob` | Runtime Knowledge Source kind. Keep aligned with `foundryIqPattern`; use `searchIndex` only for Pattern B. |
| `foundryIqStorageContainerName` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_STORAGE_CONTAINER_NAME` | `documents` | Blob or ADLS Gen2 container for native Foundry IQ ingestion. |
| `foundryIqStorageFolderPath` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_STORAGE_FOLDER_PATH` | Empty | Optional folder path within the native Blob or ADLS Gen2 container. |
| `foundryIqIsAdlsGen2` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_IS_ADLS_GEN2` | `false` | Set to `true` when the native source is an ADLS Gen2 account with hierarchical namespace. |
| `foundryIqIngestionPermissionOptionsJson` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_INGESTION_PERMISSION_OPTIONS` | `["rbacScope"]` | JSON array of permission metadata to ingest for native Foundry IQ sources. |
| `foundryIqSearchIndexName` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_SEARCH_INDEX_NAME` | `gpt-rag-index` | Existing Azure AI Search index to register for Pattern B. |
| `foundryIqSemanticConfigurationName` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_SEMANTIC_CONFIGURATION_NAME` | `default` | Semantic configuration on the existing index. |
| `foundryIqFilterAddOnEnabled` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_FILTER_ADD_ON_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables GPT-RAG query-time security filtering for Pattern B. Leave `false` for native Blob. |
| `foundryIqSecurityFieldName` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_SECURITY_FIELD_NAME` | `metadata_security_id` | Field used by the orchestrator to build Pattern B filters. |
| `foundryIqMaxOutputDocuments` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_MAX_OUTPUT_DOCUMENTS` | Empty | Optional cap on documents returned by the knowledge base. |
| `foundryIqContentExtractionMode` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_MODE` | `standard` | Native Blob content extraction mode. `standard` uses the Foundry IQ Content Understanding skill (layout and OCR) so scanned and image-only PDFs are ingested with text. `minimal` skips Content Understanding and only ingests text already present in the source. The setting is immutable on an existing Knowledge Source. |
| `foundryIqAiServicesEndpoint` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_AI_SERVICES_ENDPOINT` | Derived from the Foundry account | Required by Azure AI Search when `FOUNDRY_IQ_CONTENT_EXTRACTION_MODE=standard`. Leave empty for deployments that create the Foundry account, or set it to `https://<foundry-resource>.services.ai.azure.com/` when reusing an existing Foundry resource. |
| `foundryIqBaseFilter` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_BASE_FILTER` | Empty | Optional persisted filter for the Pattern B knowledge source. |
| `foundryIqSourceDataFields` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_SOURCE_DATA_FIELDS` | Template default | Fields exposed by the Pattern B knowledge source. |
| `foundryIqSearchFields` / `FOUNDRY_IQ_SEARCH_FIELDS` | Template default | Searchable fields used by the Pattern B knowledge source. |

Security expectations:

- Pattern B (`searchIndex`) keeps the existing GPT-RAG index and enforces
  GPT-RAG security fields through query-time `filterAddOn`.
- Native Foundry IQ permissions use `x-ms-query-source-authorization` and require
  a source that ingests permissions, such as ADLS Gen2 ACLs, SharePoint,
  OneLake/Fabric, or Purview labels.
- Plain Blob storage is container-level RBAC for this purpose. Do not claim
  per-document trimming for plain Blob unless Purview labels or an equivalent
  per-document permission source are used.

Bicep stamps runtime configuration and creates a dedicated Foundry connection
ID, but Azure AI Search knowledge sources and knowledge bases are data-plane
objects. After provisioning, create or update them with the signed-in Azure CLI
identity:

```powershell
./scripts/Configure-FoundryIQKnowledgeBase.ps1 `
  -SearchEndpoint "https://<search-name>.search.windows.net" `
  -KnowledgeBaseName "<knowledge-base-name>" `
  -KnowledgeSourceName "<knowledge-source-name>" `
  -SearchIndexName "<gpt-rag-index-name>" `
  -SemanticConfigurationName "<semantic-config-name>" `
  -SearchServiceResourceId "/subscriptions/<sub>/resourceGroups/<rg>/providers/Microsoft.Search/searchServices/<search-name>" `
  -KnowledgeRetrievalBillingPlan "free"
```

The caller needs **Search Service Contributor** on the Search service. Use
`-KnowledgeRetrievalBillingPlan standard` only when you want to opt in to
pay-as-you-go agentic retrieval billing after the included free allowance.

### Permissions

The following role assignments are provisioned by the template based on the **default configuration** in `main.parameters.json`. This includes the default set of container apps, their associated roles, and the services they interact with. If you customize the parameters before provisioning — such as adding or removing container apps or changing role mappings — the actual assignments will vary accordingly.

### Optional Public Ingress (Application Gateway WAF v2)

**Issue #49.** The landing zone provisions the Container Apps environment in **internal** mode under network isolation, so its apps are unreachable from the public Internet by default. Some workloads need a controlled, audited public entry point (a tester, a partner integration, a public demo). The optional `publicIngress` feature deploys an **Application Gateway WAF v2** in front of the internal ACA environment without changing any of the existing internal topology.

> ⚠️ **Cost warning.** Enabling this feature deploys WAF_v2 + a Standard Public IP, which incur **hourly charges even when idle** (~USD 240/month for the gateway alone, region-dependent). Keep `publicIngress.enabled = false` unless actively needed and tear the stack down with `azd down` (or delete the resources manually) when the access window ends. **Setting `publicIngress.enabled` back to `false` after a deploy will NOT delete the resources** — `azd`/ARM incremental deployments only stop managing them.

**Default state:** disabled. No public-ingress resources are provisioned.

**Parameter contract** (`publicIngressType` exported from `main.bicep`):

```bicep
publicIngress: {
  enabled: bool                              // master toggle, default false
  backendAppIndex: int?                      // index into containerAppsList; default 0
  frontendHostName: string?                  // e.g., 'app.contoso.com' — required to activate HTTPS
  sslCertSecretId: string?                   // versionless Key Vault secret URI — required to activate HTTPS
  allowedSourceAddressPrefixes: string[]?    // CIDRs allowed to reach :443; empty list = deny-all
  wafMode: ('Prevention' | 'Detection')?     // default 'Prevention'
  wafCustomRules: object[]?                  // merged with OWASP CRS 3.2 managed ruleset
  capacity: object?                          // default { minCapacity: 0, maxCapacity: 2 }
  sslPolicy: object?                         // default Azure baseline
}
```

**Resources deployed when `enabled = true`** (only effective with `networkIsolation`, `deployContainerEnv`, and at least one entry in `containerAppsList`):

| Resource | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `Microsoft.Network/networkSecurityGroups` (`nsg-<vnet>-AppGatewaySubnet`) | Deny-all inbound except `GatewayManager` (65200-65535) and `AzureLoadBalancer`. Adds an `AllowHttpsFromAllowedSources` rule on TCP/443 only when `allowedSourceAddressPrefixes` is non-empty. **Port 80 is never opened from the Internet.** |
| `Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses` | Standard SKU, Static, zone-redundant when `useZoneRedundancy=true`. |
| `Microsoft.Network/ApplicationGatewayWebApplicationFirewallPolicies` | OWASP CRS 3.2, mode `Prevention` (or `Detection`), `wafCustomRules` merged in. |
| `Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities` | Dedicated UAI for the gateway. |
| `Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments` (`Key Vault Secrets User`) | Granted to the AGW UAI on the landing-zone Key Vault when `deployKeyVault=true`. External Key Vaults must be granted manually. |
| `Microsoft.Network/applicationGateways` | WAF_v2 SKU, autoscale 0..2, zone-redundant, attached to the existing `AppGatewaySubnet` (192.168.3.0/27). Backend pool targets the Container App's internal FQDN over HTTPS:443 with `pickHostNameFromBackendAddress=true`. |
| Diagnostic settings | Streamed to the existing Log Analytics workspace (`allLogs` + `AllMetrics`). |

**Two operational states:**

1. **Skeleton mode** (`enabled=true` and either `sslCertSecretId` or `frontendHostName` empty)
   - Gateway exists with a single HTTP:80 listener routed to the backend.
   - NSG denies all Internet inbound (port 80 is never opened by the NSG).
   - The skeleton is **inert**: no client can reach it from the Internet until the operator transitions to live mode.

2. **Live mode** (`enabled=true` with both `sslCertSecretId` and `frontendHostName` set, plus `allowedSourceAddressPrefixes` non-empty)
   - HTTPS:443 listener using the Key Vault certificate (the AGW UAI reads it via `Key Vault Secrets User`).
   - HTTP:80 becomes a permanent HTTP→HTTPS redirect.
   - NSG allows TCP/443 from the supplied source CIDRs only.

**Post-deploy runbook (provider-agnostic DNS + jumpbox ACME):**

1. **Workstation (DNS provider side):** choose your DNS provider/registrar and prepare your hostname (example: `app.contoso.com`). No provider-specific integration is required in this landing zone.
2. **Jumpbox (certificate issuance/import side):** use the built-in ACME client installed by `install.ps1` at `C:\tools\win-acme\wacs.exe` (DNS-01 flow), then import the resulting certificate into the landing-zone Key Vault. The jumpbox MI has `Key Vault Certificates Officer` for this workflow.
3. **Workstation (DNS provider side):** create/update the public DNS A record for the hostname pointing at `PUBLIC_INGRESS_PUBLIC_IP` (deployment output).
4. Capture the **versionless** Key Vault secret URI for the certificate (`https://<kv>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<name>`), then set operator parameters in `main.parameters.json` (or via `azd env set` followed by an edit since `publicIngress` is an aggregate object):
   ```jsonc
   "publicIngress": {
      "value": {
       "enabled": true,
       "frontendHostName": "app.contoso.com",
       "sslCertSecretId": "https://<kv>.vault.azure.net/secrets/<name>",
        "allowedSourceAddressPrefixes": ["203.0.113.0/24"]
      }
    }

5. Run `azd provision` again. The HTTPS listener, redirect rule, and NSG allow rule are now in place.
6. Validate end-to-end: `curl -v https://app.contoso.com/` should return the Container App's response; `curl -v http://app.contoso.com/` should redirect to HTTPS.

**Teardown:** run `azd down` to remove the entire deployment, or delete the gateway/PIP/WAF policy/NSG/UAI manually. As stated above, flipping `enabled` back to `false` and re-provisioning will **not** delete the resources due to ARM incremental deployment semantics.

**Outputs surfaced by `main.bicep`:**

| Output | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_ENABLED` | Whether the stack was effectively deployed (also requires `networkIsolation` + `deployContainerEnv` + non-empty `containerAppsList`). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_PUBLIC_IP` | The gateway's public IPv4 address (point your DNS A record at this). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_GATEWAY_RESOURCE_ID` | Application Gateway resource ID. |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_NSG_RESOURCE_ID` | NSG attached to the AGW subnet. |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_WAF_POLICY_RESOURCE_ID` | WAF policy resource ID (for adding custom rules outside the template). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_IDENTITY_PRINCIPAL_ID` | Principal ID of the AGW UAI (use to grant access to external Key Vaults). |
| `PUBLIC_INGRESS_LIVE` | `true` only when both `sslCertSecretId` and `frontendHostName` are set (live mode). |

In addition, the landing zone now surfaces a small set of outputs that consumers (and this module) depend on: `APP_GATEWAY_SUBNET_RESOURCE_ID`, `VNET_RESOURCE_ID`, `KEY_VAULT_RESOURCE_ID`, `KEY_VAULT_NAME`, `LOG_ANALYTICS_RESOURCE_ID`, and `CONTAINER_APP_INTERNAL_FQDN`.
